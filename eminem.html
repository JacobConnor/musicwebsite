                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known
                professionally as Eminem (often stylized as EMINÆŽM), is an
                American rapper, songwriter, record producer, and actor from
                Detroit, Michigan. In addition to his solo career, he is a
                member of D12, and with Royce da 5'9" is one half of the
                hip-hop duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem is the best-selling artist
                of the 2000s in the United States. Rolling Stone ranked him
                83rd on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, calling
                him the King of Hip Hop. Including his work with D12 and Bad
                Meets Evil, Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the
                Billboard 200. He has sold more than 172 million albums, making
                him one of the world's best-selling artists. As of June 2014,
                Eminem is the second-bestselling male artist of the Nielsen
                SoundScan era, the sixth-bestselling artist in the United
                States and the bestselling hip-hop artist, with sales of 45.1
                million albums and 42 million tracks (including 31 million
                digital single certifications).</p>
                <p>After his debut album Infinite (1996), Eminem achieved
                mainstream popularity in 1999 with his The Slim Shady LP, which
                earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next
                two releases, 2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The
                Eminem Show, were worldwide successes, with each being
                certified diamond in U.S. sales and both winning Best Rap Album
                Grammy Awards (making Eminem the first artist to win the award
                for three consecutive LPs). They were followed by Encore in
                2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on
                hiatus after touring in 2005, releasing Relapse in 2009 and
                Recovery in 2010. Both won Grammy Awards and Recovery was the
                best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, the second time he had
                the international best-selling album of the year (after The
                Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album, 2013's The Marshall
                Mathers LP 2, won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album;
                it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and
                his Grammy total to 15.</p>
                <p>Eminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records
                with manager Paul Rosenberg. He has his own channel, Shade 45,
                on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, Eminem starred in the hip
                hop film 8 Mile. He won the Academy Award for Best Original
                Song for "Lose Yourself", the first rap artist to win the
                award. Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash
                (2001), Funny People (2009), The Interview (2014) and the
                television series Entourage (2010).</p>
