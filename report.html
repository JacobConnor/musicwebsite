            <h1>Report</h1>
            <p>When creating this website I followed five facets. The five
            facets are purpose, content, visual, technology and delivery. The
            website design contains all five of these features. It is simple,
            easy to navigavte and reponsive. The content on the site is well
            structured so that users can take in information with ease. The
            visual layout follows the conventions to help the user be familiar
            with the site when they load it. Some of these conventions are, the
            logo in the left corner, the logo is a link to the homepage, back
            to top links on long pages. The site makes use of html and css to
            make the site more user friendly. The delivery speeds of the
            website are fast as the images are mostly small in size. The design
            follows the web standards set by W3C.</p>
            <p>The website conforms to accessibility standards as all
            information on the website is clear and easy to read, provides
            clear and easy navigation, is reponsive and able to be viewed on
            multiple different sized devices, uses markup and style sheets,
            clarifies the language in use etc.</p>
            <p>Navigation of the site is easy and well displayed no matter what
            devices the user would use. It will always be at the top and always
            have navigation to each page. The logo as following web conventions
            will take a user to the home page if clicked.</p>
            <p>I think i should be awarded the contract as the site contains
            all of the requirments requested by the record company. It is
            simple easy to navigate and does exactly what it needs to do. The
            website follows web design standards and accessibility standards
            including it being responsive and easy to use on all devices.</p>
