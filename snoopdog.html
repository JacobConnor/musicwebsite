                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>Cordozar Calvin Broadus, Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known
                professionally as Snoop Dogg (formerly Snoop Doggy Dogg), is an
                American rapper and actor from Long Beach, California. His
                music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by Dr. Dre of
                N.W.A, and as a result was prominently featured throughout Dr.
                Dre's solo debut album, The Chronic (1992). He has since sold
                over twenty-three million albums in the United States and
                thirty-five million albums worldwide.</p>
                <p>Snoop's debut album, Doggystyle, was released in 1993 under
                Death Row Records, debuting at number one on both the Billboard
                200 and Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Selling almost
                a million copies in the first week of its release, Doggystyle
                became certified 4× platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit
                singles, including "What's My Name?" and "Gin & Juice". In 1994
                Snoop released a soundtrack on Death Row Records for the short
                film Murder Was The Case, starring himself. His second album
                Tha Doggfather (1996), also debuted at number one on both
                charts with "Snoop's Upside Ya Head", as the lead single. The
                album was certified double platinum in 1997.</p>
                <p>After leaving Death Row Records, Snoop signed with No Limit
                Records, where he recorded his next three albums. Da Game Is to
                Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and
                Tha Last Meal (2000). Snoop then signed with
                Priority/Capitol/EMI Records in 2002, where he released Paid
                tha Cost to Be da Boss. He then signed with Geffen Records in
                2004 for his next three albums R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The
                Masterpiece, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin'.
                Malice 'n Wonderland (2009), and Doggumentary (2011), were
                released on Priority. Snoop Dogg has starred in motion pictures
                and hosted several television shows, including Doggy Fizzle
                Televizzle, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood, and Dogg After Dark. He
                also coaches a youth football league and high school football
                team. In September 2009, Snoop was hired by EMI as the chairman
                of a reactivated Priority Records.</p>
                <p>In 2012, after a trip to Jamaica, Snoop announced a
                conversion to the Rastafari movement and a new alias, Snoop
                Lion. Under the new moniker, he released a reggae album,
                Reincarnated, and a documentary film of the same name, of his
                Jamaican experience, in early 2013. His thirteenth solo studio
                album, Bush, was released in May 2015.</p>
                <p>Snoop Dogg holds the dubious distinction of having seventeen
                Grammy nominations without a win, the most of any artist.</p>
                <p>In March 2016, the night before WrestleMania 32 in
                Arlington, Texas, Snoop was inducted into the celebrity wing of
                the WWE Hall of Fame having made several appearances for the
                company, including as Master of Ceremonies during a match at
                Wrestlemania XXIV.[6] His first cousin, Sasha Banks, is a
                wrestler in WWE, where she is the current WWE Women's
                Champion.</p>
