                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>Andre Romelle Young (born February 18, 1965), better known
                by his stage name Dr. Dre, is an American rapper, record
                producer, and entrepreneur. He is the founder and current CEO
                of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics. Dre was
                previously the co-owner of, and an artist on, Death Row
                Records. He has produced albums for and overseen the careers of
                many rappers, including 2Pac, The D.O.C., Snoop Dogg, Eminem,
                Xzibit, Knoc-turn'al, 50 Cent, The Game and Kendrick Lamar. He
                is credited as a key figure in the popularization of West Coast
                G-funk, a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based
                with slow, heavy beats. In 2014, Dr. Dre was ranked as the
                second richest figure in the American hip hop scene by Forbes
                with a net worth of $550 million; he is at the top of the 2015
                Forbes list, with an estimated pre-tax take of $620 million in
                2014.</p>
                <p>Dre began his career as a member of the World Class Wreckin'
                Cru and later found fame with the influential gangsta rap group
                N.W.A with Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella, which
                popularized the use of explicit lyrics in rap to detail the
                violence of street life. His 1992 solo debut The Chronic,
                released under Death Row Records, led him to become one of the
                best-selling American performing artists of 1993 and to win a
                Grammy Award for the single "Let Me Ride". That same year he
                produced Death Row labelmate Snoop Dogg's quadruple platinum
                debut Doggystyle, and even molded artists into top-notch
                producers such as his step-brother Warren G, which led to his
                multi-platinum debut Regulate...G Funk Era in 1994, and Snoop
                Dogg's cousin Daz Dillinger which led to the double platinum
                debut album Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound in 1995.</p>
                <p>In 1996, he left Death Row Records to establish his own
                label, Aftermath Entertainment. He produced a compilation album
                titled Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath in 1996, and released a
                solo album titled 2001 in 1999. During the 2000s, he focused on
                production for other artists, while occasionally contributing
                vocals to songs. Dr. Dre signed Eminem in 1998 and 50 Cent in
                2002 to his record label respectively, while contributing
                production on their albums. He has won six Grammy Awards,
                including Producer of the Year. Dr. Dre has also had acting
                roles in movies such as Set It Off, The Wash and Training Day.
                Rolling Stone ranked Dre at 56 on their list of "100 Greatest
                Artists of All-Time".</p>
